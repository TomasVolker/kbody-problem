This repository contains a simple 
[euler solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) 
to visualize the 
[n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem). 

The implementation is done in Kotlin and graphics implemented 
in [OpenRNDR](https://openrndr.org/).

To run the application, simple execute the `run` task on the
gradle wrapper:
```
./gradlew run
```
